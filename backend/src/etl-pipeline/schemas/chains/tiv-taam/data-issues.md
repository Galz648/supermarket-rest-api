# TIV_TAAM Data Quality Issues

## Store Data Issues

### Data Completeness
1. **Store Information**: Complete store information including addresses, cities, and zip codes
2. **Store Types**: Consistent store type values (all "1")
3. **Subchain Information**: All stores use the same subchain ID and name ("1")

### Data Quality Concerns
1. **Bikoret Numbers**: Single-digit values (0-9) with unclear meaning or purpose
2. **Store IDs**: Numeric values with gaps in the sequence
3. **Last Update Times**: All stores have the same last update date and time

### Recommendations
1. **Documentation**: Clarify the meaning of bikoret numbers
2. **Validation**: Implement validation for store ID uniqueness and sequence
3. **Data Enrichment**: Consider adding more detailed store type information
4. **Monitoring**: Track last update times to ensure data freshness 

## Item Data Quality Issues

### Data Completeness
1. **Manufacturer Information**
   - Many items have "לא ידוע" (Unknown) as manufacturer name
   - Some items have empty manufacturer names (e.g., ",                    ,")
   - Country of origin is often marked as "לא ידוע"

2. **Unit Information**
   - Some items have "Unknown" as unit quantity
   - Missing unit of measure for certain items
   - Inconsistent unit formats (e.g., "ק\"ג" vs "קילוגרמים")

### Data Quality Concerns
1. **Price Updates**
   - Some items have future dates for price updates (e.g., "2025-03-23 22:32")
   - Inconsistent date formats in price update timestamps
   - Some items have very old price update dates (e.g., "2019-07-24 20:27")

2. **Item Codes**
   - Mix of different code formats (numeric, barcode-like)
   - Some items have very short codes (e.g., "9966", "9988")
   - Special items (like delivery fees) use numeric codes

3. **Quantity and Units**
   - Some weighted items have quantity "0.00"
   - Inconsistent unit of measure display (e.g., "100 מ\"ל" vs "מיליליטרים")
   - Some items marked as weighted (bisweighted=1) have no quantity

4. **Special Items**
   - Delivery and pickup fees are included as items
   - Coupon items have symbolic prices (0.10)
   - Some promotional items have unusual price structures

### Recommendations
1. **Data Standardization**
   - Standardize unit of measure formats
   - Implement consistent date format for price updates
   - Create separate handling for special items (delivery, coupons)

2. **Data Validation**
   - Validate price update dates against current date
   - Ensure quantity values are present for weighted items
   - Verify manufacturer information completeness

3. **Data Enrichment**
   - Consider enriching manufacturer information
   - Standardize country of origin data
   - Implement proper categorization for special items

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track items with future price update dates
   - Monitor for unusual price structures
   - Watch for missing or inconsistent unit information
