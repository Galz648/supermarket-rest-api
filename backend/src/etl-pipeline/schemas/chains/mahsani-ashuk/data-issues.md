# MAHSANI ASHUK Data Quality Issues

## File Structure and Organization
- Files follow a consistent naming pattern: `[Type][ChainID]-[StoreID]-[Timestamp]-[Sequence].xml`
- Multiple file types available:
  - Price files: Regular price updates
  - PriceFull files: Complete price catalog
  - Promo files: Current promotions
  - PromoFull files: Complete promotional catalog
  - Stores files: Store information
- Files are updated frequently throughout the day, with timestamps indicating hourly updates
- Store IDs follow a consistent format (e.g., 001, 202, 230, 801)
- Files include a sequence number (-001) which may indicate versioning or batch processing

## Data Completeness
### Store Data
- Store information includes essential fields:
  - Chain ID
  - Store ID
  - Store name
  - Address
  - City
  - Optional zip code
- Need to verify if all stores have complete address information

### Product Data
- Product information includes:
  - Item code
  - Item name
  - Manufacturer details
  - Unit quantities
  - Barcodes
  - Price information
  - Discount status
- Some fields are optional and may need validation

## Data Quality Concerns
### Store Data
- Verify consistency of store IDs across different file types
- Check for duplicate store entries
- Validate address format and completeness
- Monitor store ID patterns (mix of 3-digit and 4-digit IDs)

### Product Data
- Ensure price consistency between Price and PriceFull files
- Validate barcode formats and uniqueness
- Check for missing manufacturer information
- Verify unit of measure consistency
- Monitor sequence numbers in file names for version control

### Promotional Data
- Monitor promo file update frequency
- Validate promo dates and durations
- Check for conflicting promotions
- Verify promo data consistency across stores
- Track sequence numbers in promo files

## Recommendations
1. **Data Validation**
   - Implement checks for required fields in store data

   - Add validation for store ID formats
   - Monitor sequence numbers in file names

2. **Documentation**
   - Document file update patterns
   - Maintain a log of data quality issues
   - Track missing or incomplete data

   - Document sequence number usage

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for missing files
   - Monitor file update frequency
   - Track data completeness metrics
   - Monitor store ID consistency
   - Track sequence number patterns

4. **Data Quality Improvements**
   - Implement automated validation for store data
