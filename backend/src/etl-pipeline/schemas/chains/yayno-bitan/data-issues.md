# YAYNO BITAN Data Quality Issues

## File Structure and Organization
- Files follow a consistent naming pattern: `[Type][ChainID]-[StoreID]-[Timestamp].xml`
- Multiple file types available:
  - Price files: Regular price updates
  - PriceFull files: Complete price catalog
  - Promo files: Current promotions
  - PromoFull files: Complete promotional catalog
  - Stores files: Store information
- Files are updated frequently throughout the day, with timestamps indicating hourly updates
- Store IDs follow a consistent format (e.g., 0014, 0077, 2560, 3010, 9032)

## Data Completeness
### Store Data
- Store information includes essential fields:
  - Chain ID
  - Store ID
  - Store name
  - Address
  - City

### Product Data
- Product information includes:
  - Item code
  - Item name
  - Manufacturer details
  - Unit quantities

## Data Quality Concerns
### Store Data
