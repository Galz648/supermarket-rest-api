# BAREKET Data Quality Issues

## File Structure and Organization
- Files follow a consistent naming pattern: `[Type][ChainID]-[StoreID]-[Timestamp].aspx.xml`
- Multiple file types available:
  - Price files: Regular price updates
  - PriceFull files: Complete price catalog
  - Promo files: Current promotions
  - PromoFull files: Complete promotional catalog
  - Stores files: Store information
- Files are updated frequently throughout the day, with timestamps indicating hourly updates
- Store IDs follow a consistent format (e.g., 002, 005, 062, 066)
- Files use .aspx.xml extension, which may indicate a specific data source or format

## Data Completeness
### Store Data
- Store information includes essential fields:
  - Chain ID
  - Store ID
  - Store name
  - Address
  - City
  - Optional zip code
- Need to verify if all stores have complete address information

### Product Data
- Product information includes:
  - Item code
  - Item name
  - Manufacturer details
  - Unit quantities
  - Barcodes
  - Price information
  - Discount status
- Some fields are optional and may need validation

## Data Quality Concerns
### Store Data
- Verify consistency of store IDs across different file types
- Check for duplicate store entries
- Validate address format and completeness
- Monitor store ID patterns (mix of 2-digit and 3-digit IDs)

### Product Data
- Ensure price consistency between Price and PriceFull files
- Validate barcode formats and uniqueness
- Check for missing manufacturer information
- Verify unit of measure consistency
- Monitor file extension consistency (.aspx.xml)

### Promotional Data
- Monitor promo file update frequency
- Validate promo dates and durations
- Check for conflicting promotions
- Verify promo data consistency across stores
- Track file extension patterns
