# VICTORY Data Quality Issues

## File Structure and Organization
1. **File Types and Naming**
   - Store files use the format `StoresFull7290696200003-000-YYYYMMDDHHMM-000.xml`
   - Promo files use the format `Promo7290696200003-XXX-YYYYMMDDHHMM-001.xml`
   - PromoFull files use the format `PromoFull7290696200003-XXX-YYYYMMDDHHMM-001.xml`
   - Consistent chain ID (7290696200003) across all files

2. **Update Frequency**
   - Files show frequent updates (multiple updates per hour)
   - Timestamps in filenames indicate regular refresh cycles
   - Store data updates appear less frequent than promotional data

## Data Completeness Concerns
1. **Store Information**
   - Store files follow a Full format (StoresFull)
   - Need to verify if all store metadata is included
   - Potential gaps in store details need investigation

2. **Promotional Data**
   - Two types of promo files (Promo and PromoFull)
   - Multiple store-specific promo files (indicated by store numbers in filenames)
   - High update frequency suggests active promotional management

## Data Quality Concerns
1. **File Versioning**
   - Multiple versions of the same file type with different timestamps
   - Need to establish which version should be considered authoritative
   - Potential for data inconsistency between versions

2. **Data Access**
   - Price data accessibility issues need resolution
   - May affect ability to maintain accurate price information
   - Could impact real-time price updates

## Recommendations
1. **Data Access Improvement**
   - Investigate price data access issues
   - Establish reliable methods to retrieve price information
   - Consider alternative data retrieval methods if API issues persist

2. **Data Validation**
   - Implement checks for file availability
   - Monitor update frequencies
   - Verify data consistency across different file versions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document file naming conventions
   - Track update patterns
   - Maintain log of data access issues

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for missing price data
   - Track file update frequencies
   - Monitor for unexpected changes in file structure

## Store Data Issues

### Data Completeness
1. **Store Information**: Complete address and city information
2. **Store Types**: Consistent store type values (all "1")
3. **Subchain Information**: All stores use the same subchain ID and name ("1")

### Data Quality Concerns
1. **Zip Codes**: All stores have "unknown" as their zip code value
2. **Bikoret Numbers**: Single-digit values (0-9) with unclear meaning or purpose
3. **Store IDs**: Numeric values with gaps in the sequence
4. **Last Update Times**: All stores have the same last update date and time

### Recommendations
1. **Data Enrichment**: Add valid zip codes for all stores
2. **Documentation**: Clarify the meaning of bikoret numbers
3. **Validation**: Implement validation for store ID uniqueness and sequence
4. **Monitoring**: Track last update times to ensure data freshness
