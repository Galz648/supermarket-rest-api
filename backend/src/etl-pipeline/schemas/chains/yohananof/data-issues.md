# YOHANANOF Data Quality Issues

## File Structure and Organization
1. **File Types and Naming**
   - Store files use the format `StoresFull7290803800003-000-YYYYMMDDHHMM-000.xml`
   - Promo files use the format `Promo7290803800003-XXX-YYYYMMDDHHMM-001.xml`
   - PromoFull files use the format `PromoFull7290803800003-XXX-YYYYMMDDHHMM-001.xml`
   - Consistent chain ID (7290803800003) across all files

2. **Update Frequency**
   - Files show frequent updates (multiple updates per hour)
   - Timestamps in filenames indicate regular refresh cycles
   - Store data updates appear less frequent than promotional data
   - Some files show multiple versions within minutes of each other

## Data Completeness Concerns
1. **Store Information**
   - Single store file format without "Full" designation
   - Need to verify if all store metadata is included
   - Potential gaps in store details need investigation

2. **Promotional Data**
   - Two types of promo files (Promo and PromoFull)
   - Large number of store-specific promo files (indicated by store numbers in filenames)
   - High update frequency suggests active promotional management
   - Some stores have multiple promotional updates within the same hour

## Data Quality Concerns
1. **File Versioning**
   - Multiple versions of the same file type with different timestamps
   - Need to establish which version should be considered authoritative
   - Potential for data inconsistency between versions
   - Some files show rapid succession of updates (e.g., within minutes)

2. **Data Access**
   - Price data accessibility issues need resolution
   - May affect ability to maintain accurate price information
   - Could impact real-time price updates

3. **File Organization**
   - Large number of individual store promotional files
   - Complex file versioning with multiple updates
   - Potential for confusion between Promo and PromoFull files

## Recommendations
1. **Data Access Improvement**
   - Investigate price data access issues
   - Establish reliable methods to retrieve price information
   - Consider alternative data retrieval methods if API issues persist

2. **Data Validation**
   - Implement checks for file availability
   - Monitor update frequencies
   - Verify data consistency across different file versions
   - Track rapid succession updates

3. **Documentation**
   - Document file naming conventions
   - Track update patterns
   - Maintain log of data access issues
   - Document differences between Promo and PromoFull files

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for missing price data
   - Track file update frequencies
   - Monitor for unexpected changes in file structure
   - Watch for abnormal update patterns

## Store Data Issues

### Data Completeness
1. **Store Information**: Incomplete address and city information for many stores
2. **Store Types**: Mostly consistent (type "1"), with one exception (type "2")
3. **Subchain Information**: All stores use the same subchain ID and name ("1")

### Data Quality Concerns
1. **Zip Codes**: All stores have "unknown" as their zip code value
2. **Addresses**: Many stores have missing address information (marked as "unknown")
3. **Cities**: Several stores have missing city information (marked as "unknown")
4. **Bikoret Numbers**: Single-digit values (0-9) with unclear meaning or purpose
5. **Store IDs**: Numeric values with gaps in the sequence
6. **Last Update Times**: All stores have the same last update date and time

### Recommendations
1. **Data Enrichment**: Add valid zip codes, addresses, and cities for all stores
2. **Documentation**: Clarify the meaning of bikoret numbers and store types
3. **Validation**: Implement validation for store ID uniqueness and sequence
4. **Monitoring**: Track last update times to ensure data freshness
5. **Store Type Investigation**: Investigate the meaning of different store types
