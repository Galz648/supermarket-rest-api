# Data Quality Summary Across Chains

## Common Data Access Issues
1. **Price Data Accessibility**
   - Multiple chains (VICTORY, YOHANANOF) show issues with price data access
   - Price files often return empty results
   - Inconsistent availability of price information across chains

2. **File Structure Variations**
   - Each chain uses slightly different file naming conventions
   - Inconsistent use of "Full" designation in file names
   - Different approaches to store numbering and identification

## Data Quality Patterns

### Store Data
1. **Common Issues**
   - Inconsistent store identification methods
   - Varying levels of store metadata completeness
   - Different update frequencies across chains

2. **Chain-Specific Patterns**
   - TIV_TAAM: Generally good data quality with complete store information
   - VICTORY: Good store data but issues with price data access
   - YOHANANOF: Complex file organization with frequent updates

### Promotional Data
1. **Update Patterns**
   - High frequency of updates across all chains
   - Multiple versions of promotional files
   - Complex relationship between regular and "Full" promo files

2. **Common Challenges**
   - Version control and file authority
   - Rapid succession of updates
   - Store-specific vs. chain-wide promotions

## Data Completeness

### Metadata
1. **Store Information**
   - Varying levels of detail across chains
   - Inconsistent use of optional fields
   - Different approaches to store categorization

2. **Product Information**
   - Manufacturer details often incomplete
   - Inconsistent unit measurements
   - Varying approaches to product categorization

## Recommendations for ETL Pipeline

### Data Validation
1. **File Availability**
   - Implement robust error handling for missing files
   - Set up monitoring for file access issues
   - Create fallback mechanisms for unavailable data

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Standardize data formats across chains
   - Implement version control for file updates
   - Validate data completeness and accuracy

### Monitoring
1. **Access Monitoring**
   - Track file availability patterns
   - Monitor update frequencies
   - Alert on unexpected data access issues

2. **Quality Monitoring**
   - Track data completeness metrics
   - Monitor for unusual update patterns
   - Validate data consistency across chains

### Documentation
1. **Standards**
   - Maintain central documentation of file formats
   - Document chain-specific variations
   - Keep updated mapping of data fields

2. **Issues Tracking**
   - Log recurring data quality issues
   - Track resolution of known problems
   - Document workarounds for common issues
