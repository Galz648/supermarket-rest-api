# YOHANANOF Data Quality Issues

## Store Data Issues

### Missing Data
1. **Zip Codes**: All stores have "unknown" as their zip code value
2. **Addresses**: Many stores have missing address information (marked as "unknown")
3. **Cities**: Several stores have missing city information (marked as "unknown")

### Data Inconsistencies
1. **Store Types**: Most stores have `storetype: "1"`, but one store (ID 150) has `storetype: "2"` (possibly indicating a different store format)
2. **Store Names**: Some store names are very generic (e.g., "בת ים", "נתניה") while others are more specific (e.g., "יוחננוף מפוח", "חוצות המפרץ")
3. **Bikoret Numbers**: The `bikoretno` field appears to be a single digit (0-9) with no clear pattern or meaning

### Data Structure Observations
1. **Store IDs**: Store IDs are numeric and range from 1 to 150, but there are gaps in the sequence
2. **Subchain Information**: All stores have the same subchain ID and name ("1")
3. **Last Update**: All stores have the same last update date and time (2025-04-04 01:00:00)

### Recommendations
1. **Data Validation**: Implement validation for required fields (address, city, zip code)
2. **Data Enrichment**: Consider enriching missing address and city information
3. **Store Type Documentation**: Document the meaning of different store types
4. **Bikoret Number Documentation**: Clarify the purpose and meaning of the bikoret number field
5. **Subchain Structure**: Investigate if the single subchain value is correct or if there should be more subchain differentiation
